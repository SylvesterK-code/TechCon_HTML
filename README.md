Practical _ building site for TechCon 2024 conference 



# TechCon 2024 Conference Website

## Overview
The **TechCon 2024** project is a comprehensive HTML-based website designed to showcase the annual technology conference — **TechCon 2024**.  
This project demonstrates the practical application of core HTML concepts including semantic structure, multimedia embedding, navigation, tables, and forms.

The website consists of **five main webpages**, each focusing on a specific aspect of the event:

1. **Homepage (`index.html`)** – Introduction and overview of TechCon 2024 with a promotional video.  
2. **About Page (`about.html`)** – History, mission, and featured speakers of the conference.  
3. **Schedule Page (`schedule.html`)** – A detailed timetable of sessions and speakers presented in a structured table.  
4. **Register Page (`register.html`)** – A registration form allowing users to sign up for the event.  
5. **Contact Page (`contact.html`)** – Contact details, social media links, embedded map, and a contact form.
